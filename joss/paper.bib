To conduct this research, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) used both quantitative and qualitative methods, including a literature review, aggregate analysis of aviation accident data, and interviews with a broad selection of government, industry, and other stakeholders. In addition, the NTSB conducted 10 detailed investigations of turbulence-related Part 121 accidents over the course of this research. The NTSB identified the following safety issues: (1) insufficient submission and dissemination of turbulence observations, (2) a lack of shared awareness of turbulence risks, (3) the need for mitigation of common turbulence-related injury circumstances, and (4) the need for updated turbulence guidance. As a result of this safety research, the NTSB makes 18 new recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), 2 new recommendations to the National Weather Service, and 1 new recommendation to Airlines for America, the National Air Carrier Association, and the Regional Airline Association. The NTSB also reiterates three recommendations to the FAA and classifies and reiterates one additional recommendation to the FAA.},

As the air transport industry expands and is continuously growing, investigating global response of aviation turbulence under climate change scenarios is required for preparing optimal and safe flying plans for the future. This study examines future frequencies of moderate-or-greater-intensity turbulence generated from various sources, viz., clear-air turbulence and mountain-wave turbulence that are concentrated in midlatitudes, and near-cloud turbulence that is concentrated in tropics and subtropics, using long-term climate model data of high-emissions scenario and historical condition. Here, we show that turbulence generated from all three sources is intensified with higher occurrences globally in changed climate compared to the historical period. Although previous studies have reported intensification of clear-air turbulence in changing climate, implying bumpier flights in the future, we show that intensification of mountain-wave turbulence and near-cloud turbulence can also be expected with changing climate.},

Here we use climate model simulations to study the impact that climate change could have on global CAT by the period 2050--2080. We extend previous work by analyzing eight geographic regions, two flight levels, five turbulence strength categories, and four seasons. We find large relative increases in CAT, especially in the midlatitudes in both hemispheres, with some regions experiencing several hundred per cent more turbulence. The busiest international airspace experiences the largest increases, with the volume of severe CAT approximately doubling over North America, the North Pacific, and Europe. Over the North Atlantic, severe CAT in future becomes as common as moderate CAT historically. These results highlight the increasing need to improve operational CAT forecasts and to use them effectively in flight planning, to limit discomfort and injuries among passengers and crew.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is expected to strengthen the vertical wind shears at aircraft cruising altitudes within the atmospheric jet streams. Such a strengthening would increase the prevalence of the shear instabilities that generate clear-air turbulence. Climate modelling studies have indicated that the amount of moderate-or-greater clear-air turbulence on transatlantic flight routes in winter will increase significantly in future as the climate changes. However, the individual responses of light, moderate, and severe clear-air turbulence have not previously been studied, despite their importance for aircraft operations. Here, we use climate model simulations to analyse the transatlantic wintertime clear-air turbulence response to climate change in five aviation-relevant turbulence strength categories. We find that the probability distributions for an ensemble of 21 clear-air turbulence diagnostics generally gain probability in their right-hand tails when the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is doubled. By converting the diagnostics into eddy dissipation rates, we find that the ensembleaverage airspace volume containing light clear-air turbulence increases by 59\% (with an intra-ensemble range of 43\%--68\%), light-to-moderate by 75\% (39\%--96\%), moderate by 94\% (37\%--118\%), moderate-to-severe by 127\% (30\%--170\%), and severe by 149\% (36\%--188\%). These results suggest that the prevalence of transatlantic wintertime clear-air turbulence will increase significantly in all aviation-relevant strength categories as the climate changes.},

This procedure minimizes forecast errors due to uncertainties in individual turbulence diagnostics and their thresholds. Thorough statistical verification studies have been performed that focused on the probabilities of correct detections of yes and no PIREPs by the forecast algorithm. Using these statistics as a guide, the authors have been able to intercompare individual diagnostic performance, and test various diagnostic threshold and weighting strategies. The overall performance of the turbulence forecast and the effect of these strategies on performance are described.},

This approach is obviously aircraft dependent and cannot accommodate the many different aircraft types that may be in the airspace. Therefore, it is proposed to provide forecasts of an atmospheric turbulence metric: the energy dissipation rate to the one-third power (EDR). A strategy is developed to statistically map automated turbulence forecast diagnostics or groups of diagnostics to EDR. The method assumes a lognormal distribution of EDR and uses climatological peak EDR data from in situ equipped aircraft in conjunction with the distribution of computed diagnostic values. These remapped values can then be combined to provide an ensemble mean EDR that is the final forecast. New mountain-wave-turbulence algorithms are presented, and the lognormal mapping is applied to them as well. The EDR forecasts are compared with aircraft in situ EDR observations and verbal pilot reports (converted to EDR) to obtain statistical performance metrics of the individual diagnostics and the ensemble mean. It is shown by one common performance metric, the area under the relative operating characteristics curve, that the ensemble mean provides better performance than forecasts from individual model diagnostics at all altitudes (low, mid-, and upper levels) and for two input NWP models.},

This paper describes a turbulence-nowcasting algorithm that combines recent short-term turbulence forecasts with all currently available direct turbulence observations and inferences of turbulence from other sources. Building upon the need to provide forecasts that are aircraft independent, the nowcasts provide estimates of an atmospheric metric of turbulence, namely, the energy dissipation rate to the one-third power (EDR). Some observations directly provide EDR, such as in situ observations from select commercial aircraft and ground-based radar algorithm output, whereas others must be translated to EDR. A strategy is provided for mapping turbulence observations, such as pilot reports (PIREPs), and inferences from other relevant observational data sources, such as observed surface wind gusts, into EDR. These remapped observation values can then be combined with short-term turbulence forecasts and other convective diagnostics of turbulence to provide a turbulence nowcast of EDR in the national airspace. Case studies are provided to illustrate the algorithm procedure and benefits. The EDR nowcasts are compared with aircraft in situ EDR observations and PIREPs converted to EDR to obtain metrics of statistical performance. It is shown by one common performance metric, the area under the relative operating characteristic curve, that the turbulence nowcasts with assimilated observations considerably outperform the corresponding turbulence forecasts.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence causes the majority of weather-related aircraft accidents. Climate models project large increases in clear-air turbulence as the jet streams become more sheared in response to climate change. However, climate models have coarser resolutions than the numerical weather prediction models that are used to forecast clear-air turbulence operationally, raising questions about their suitability for this purpose. Here we provide the first rigorous demonstration that climate models are capable of successfully diagnosing clear-air turbulence and its response to climate change. We use an ensemble of seven clear-air turbulence diagnostics to compare 38 years of historic turbulence diagnosed from climate model simulations and high-resolution reanalysis data. We find that the differences in turbulence between the climate model and reanalysis data are much smaller than the spread between the diagnostics. When using a climate model to calculate the probabilities (and their temporal trends) of encountering clear-air turbulence of any strength, at any flight cruising level, and in any season, we find that most of the uncertainty stems from the turbulence diagnostics rather than the climate model. These results confirm the suitability of climate models for the task of producing future clear-air turbulence projections. The turbulence increases are generally larger when diagnosed from the reanalysis data than the climate model, suggesting that previous quantifications from climate models of the response of clear-air turbulence to climate change may be underestimates. Our results show that the key to reducing uncertainty in projections of future clear-air turbulence lies in improving the clear-air turbulence diagnostics rather than the climate models.},

There are no modern texts on the topic. Volume II covers the formation, motion and climatology of extratropical weather systems in the context of the quasigeostrophic theory and "IPV" thinking, the formation and structure of fronts and jets, applications of semigeostrophic theory, and the observed structure and dynamics of precipitation systems in midlatitudes.},

  abstract = {An objective technique for forecasting clear-air turbulence (CAT) is described. An index is calculated based on the product of horizontal deformation and vertical wind shear derived from numerical model forecast winds aloft. The forecast technique has been evaluated and is now in operational use at two forecast centers with international aviation responsibilities: the National Meteorological Center (NMC) in Washington, D.C., and the Air Force Global Weather Central (AFGWC) in Omaha, Nebraska. The index is also an operational forecast tool at the Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service (AES), and the National Aviation Weather Advisory Unit (NAWAU) in Kansas City, Missouri, both responsible for domestic aviation forecasts. The AFGWC index also includes horizontal convergence in its calculation. Thresholds were selected empirically by comparing index values with the location and intensity of observed CAT. Verification indicates that the index is quite reliable. The probability of detection (POD) varied from 70\%--84\%. False-alarm ratios (FAR) ranged from a low of 22\% for the NMC aviation model to more than 40\% for the AFGWC global model. An average threat score of 0.17 was calculated for the aviation model 24-h forecast. The operational capabilities of the NMC and AFGWC indices are compared in two CAT episodes that differ in synoptic-scale conditions and times of the year.},
